## About Me

Hello. I am Connor Cruz! 

I love mathematics, and I spend much of my free time applying these in fun personal projects. Recently, I have been learning some abstract algebra, and I hope to use that to gain understanding in Galois Theory eventually. I have previously studied GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems using Smullyan, and I have also learned a small amount of Real Analysis.

I also really love programming! Since a very young age, I have always been fascinated about how video games and general computer programs were made. I started attempting game development at roughly 6 years old and primarily used JavaScript at 10. From then, I have learned C++ and C# for Unity, as well as Java for general use. I also wish to learn Godot as an alternative to Unity, and I want to learn Rust due to its future promise.

## Super Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

You can find this project [here](https://connor-cruz.github.io/Super-Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe/).

Do you ever think that traditional tic-tac-toe is boring and that you already know everything that it has in store? Then this game is perfect for you! It takes traditional tic-tac-toe and extends it into 2 extra dimensions, placing a mini tic-tac-toe board in each individual square. Depending on the square where the player places a marker in a mini board, the next player must place their marker in the corresponding square in the large board to the mini board. Have fun strategizing! Any conjectures?
