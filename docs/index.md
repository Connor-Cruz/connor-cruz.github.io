## Super Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

You can find this project [here](https://connor-cruz.github.io/Super-Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe/).

Do you ever think that traditional tic-tac-toe is boring and that you already know everything that it has in store? Then this game is perfect for you! It takes traditional tic-tac-toe and extends it into 2 extra dimensions, placing a mini tic-tac-toe board in each individual square. Depending on the square where the player places a marker in a mini board, the next player must place their marker in the corresponding square in the large board to the mini board. Have fun strategizing! Any conjectures?

## Memory App for Those with Dementia (Name Later)

You can find this project [here](../docs/projects/app-design.md).
