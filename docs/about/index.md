# About Me

Hello. I am Connor Cruz! 

I love mathematics, and I spend much of my free time applying these in fun personal projects. Recently, I have been learning some abstract algebra, and I hope to use that to gain understanding in Galois Theory eventually. I have previously studied GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems using Smullyan, and I have also learned a small amount of Real Analysis.

I also really love programming! Since a very young age, I have always been fascinated about how video games and general computer programs were made. I started attempting game development at roughly 6 years old and primarily used JavaScript at 10. From then, I have learned C++ and C# for Unity, as well as Java for general use. I also wish to learn Godot as an alternative to Unity, and I want to learn Rust due to its future promise.
