I am Connor Cruz! </p> <p>I love mathematics, and I spend much of my free time applying these in fun personal projects. Recently, I have been learning some abstract algebra, and I hope to use that to gain understanding in Galois Theory eventually. I have previously studied G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorems using Smullyan, and I have also learned a small amount of Real Analysis.</p> <p>I also really love programming! Since a very young age, I have always been fascinated about how video games and general computer programs were made. I started attempting game development at roughly 6 years old and primarily used JavaScript at 10. From then, I have learned C++ and C# for Unity, as well as Java for general use. I also wish to learn Godot as an alternative to Unity, and I want to learn Rust due to its future promise.</p>"},{"location":"#super-ultimate-tic-tac-toe","title":"Super Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe","text":"<p>You can find this project here.</p> <p>Do you ever think that traditional tic-tac-toe is boring and that you already know everything that it has in store? Then this game is perfect for you! It takes traditional tic-tac-toe and extends it into 2 extra dimensions, placing a mini tic-tac-toe board in each individual square. Depending on the square where the player places a marker in a mini board, the next player must place their marker in the corresponding square in the large board to the mini board. Have fun strategizing! Any conjectures?</p>"},{"location":"#memory-app-for-dementia","title":"Memory App for Dementia","text":"<p>You can find this project here.

Rather than starting directly with that, I decided to implement the card game first so that I could store images best to accomodate for the different activities in the app. </p> <p>Thus, I created the base for a game where cards lay face down and the user selects 2 cards. Each card will have a family member, and the user picks 2 cards. If they match, then the match is collected.</p> <p>Note that I did not fully implement the card game but rather the structure for it and a prototype for the image storing system.</p>"},{"location":"dementia-app/weekly-progress/#cardgame-class","title":"CardGame Class","text":"<p>Much of my work this week was done on the CardGame class, following the general plan. I created a method called \u201cinitializeGame\u201d, which performs the setup for a card game and starts the gameplay loop. Here is a snippet of the code:</p> <pre><code>public void initializeGame() {\n    assignImages();\n    shuffleCards();\n    int attempts = 20;\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; attempts; i++) {\n        selectTwo();\n    }\n    scan.close();\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The assignImages() method was very hard to make, as I had to mold the image system around that. shuffleCards required simply the Collections.shuffle() method to work, and selectTwo() was fairly easy to make given an ArrayList of cards.</p>"},{"location":"dementia-app/weekly-progress/#card-class","title":"Card Class","text":"<p>I needed to define a Card class so that the ArrayList of cards could store individual objects with an image, the person\u2019s name, and the status of the card being flipped or not.</p> <p>I created a boolean method matches() to return whether the Card has the same person as another. I also used Constructor overloading to make two possible card states: - One constructor takes a BufferedImage for the image, a String for the person\u2019s name, and an int for the card number. This creates a card that can be flipped. - The other constructor takes no argument and is solely for removed cards. This may not be necessary as of now.</p>"},{"location":"dementia-app/weekly-progress/#imagelibrary-class","title":"ImageLibrary Class","text":"<p>The ImageLibrary class is used to read a data file stored locally (to allow for data to be saved over multiple runs of the program) and the ability to read and store images on the computer.
