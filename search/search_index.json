Then this game is perfect for you! It takes traditional tic-tac-toe and extends it into 2 extra dimensions, placing a mini tic-tac-toe board in each individual square. Depending on the square where the player places a marker in a mini board, the next player must place their marker in the corresponding square in the large board to the mini board. Have fun strategizing! Any conjectures?</p>"},{"location":"#memory-app-for-those-with-dementia-name-later","title":"Memory App for Those with Dementia (Name Later)","text":"<p>You can find this project here.

Recently, I have been learning some abstract algebra, and I hope to use that to gain understanding in Galois Theory eventually. I have previously studied G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorems using Smullyan, and I have also learned a small amount of Real Analysis.</p> <p>I also really love programming! Since a very young age, I have always been fascinated about how video games and general computer programs were made. I started attempting game development at roughly 6 years old and primarily used JavaScript at 10. From then, I have learned C++ and C# for Unity, as well as Java for general use. I also wish to learn Godot as an alternative to Unity, and I want to learn Rust due to its future promise.</p>"},{"location":"projects/app-design/","title":"Memorization App for Those with Dementia","text":"<p>INSERT DESCRIPTION AND PROGRESS</p>"}]}
