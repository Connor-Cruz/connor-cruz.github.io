I am Connor Cruz! </p> <p>I love mathematics, and I spend much of my free time applying these in fun personal projects. Recently, I have been learning some abstract algebra, and I hope to use that to gain understanding in Galois Theory eventually. I have previously studied G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorems using Smullyan, and I have also learned a small amount of Real Analysis.</p> <p>I also really love programming! Since a very young age, I have always been fascinated about how video games and general computer programs were made. I started attempting game development at roughly 6 years old and primarily used JavaScript at 10. From then, I have learned C++ and C# for Unity, as well as Java for general use. I also wish to learn Godot as an alternative to Unity, and I want to learn Rust due to its future promise.</p>"},{"location":"projects/app-design/","title":"Memorization App for Those with Dementia","text":"<p>INSERT DESCRIPTION AND PROGRESS</p>"}]}
